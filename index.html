  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Shreelekh Ingle</strong>, a passionate 14-year-old tech enthusiast and self-taught developer based in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.</p>
  <p>Ever since I typed my first line of code, I‚Äôve been hooked on the creative power of programming. From building calculators and weather apps to experimenting with AI and robotics, I love solving real-world problems with code.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm currently a student at St. Xavier High School, where I balance school with deep dives into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. I spend my free time participating in coding challenges, exploring new frameworks, and watching tutorials to constantly level up.</p>
  <h3>üí° My Passion</h3>

  <h3>üöÄ Goals</h3>
  <p>My dream is to become a top software engineer, contribute to open-source projects, and eventually launch my own tech company.</p>
